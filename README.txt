Seth's Bubble Sort!

I've been messing around with cygwin and working my way through a big book
(Computer Systems from a Programmers Perspective) for the past week or so so I needed to do
do something that wasn't just practice problems, or homework problems. I made a thing!

It's a bubble sort visualizer is all but it was fun! 

Now that I'm more solid on some fundamentals this was a pretty easy program to make.

What I could have done better:
I didn't comment very well, and I didn't pay too much attention to memory management, 
I might do another commit later with some optimization.
